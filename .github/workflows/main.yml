What You‚Äôve Accomplished So Far
Game board logic: 5x5 grid initialized with correct placement of rooms and hallways.
Player movement system: Move validation with hallway connection logic and occupancy enforcement.
Client-server architecture: Functional, with communication between clients and server.
Suggestion mechanics: Players can make suggestions; suspects are moved to the room; disproval checking is partially implemented.
Client GUI: Buttons for movement and actions; room and player labels are dynamically updated.

Game Mechanics
Implement Accusations:
- Allow players to make formal accusations.
- Compare accusation against the hidden solution (not yet implemented).
- Handle win/loss conditions and notify all players.

Win/Loss Handling:
- End game when an accusation is correct.
- Eliminate players who make a wrong accusation.

Secret Passages:
- Add logic for diagonal room movement from corner rooms (Study ‚Üî Kitchen, Lounge ‚Üî Conservatory).

Card Distribution:
- On game start, randomly assign character, weapon, and room cards.
- Hide the solution (one of each type), and distribute the rest to players.

üîÅ Turn Management
Turn-based Control System:
- Add a way to cycle through player turns.
- Restrict actions (like move/suggest/accuse) to current player only.
- Send turn notifications to all clients.

Skip turns / handle blocked players:
- If a player cannot move or make a suggestion, allow them to pass or accuse.

Communication Enhancements
Broadcast Suggestions & Moves:
- Notify all players when a move or suggestion is made (not just the one making it).

Disprove Interaction:
- Prompt each other player in turn to try to disprove a suggestion.
- Make only the first one who can disprove show a card (private to suggester).

GUI Improvements (Optional)
Show Character Tokens:
- Visually display each character on the board.
- Show player names or initials on top of the room/hallway tiles.

Suggestion/Accusation Panels: (Optional)
- Separate and visually enhanced UI for making suggestions and accusations.

Game Start Screen:
Let players choose characters and wait for others before starting.

Robustness & Quality
Game State Syncing:
- Ensure all clients are synchronized after any move/suggestion/accusation.
- Possibly serialize and send a full GameBoard snapshot.

Error Handling:
Improve server-side validation and feedback for invalid commands or unexpected errors.

Logging & Debug Info:
Centralize logs and errors for easier debugging.
